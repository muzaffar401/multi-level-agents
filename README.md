# AI Assistant with Specialized Agents

A powerful AI assistant system built with multiple specialized agents, each handling specific tasks using various APIs and tools. The system uses Chainlit for the chat interface, Gemini for the underlying language model, and is built using the OpenAI Agent SDK for agent orchestration and tool management.

- Supports HTML and plain text emails
- Uses Gmail SMTP server
- Example: "Send an email to john@example.com"

### 3. Translation Agent
- Translates text between languages
- Uses Google Translate API
- Supports multiple languages
- Example: "Translate 'Hello' to Spanish"

### 4. News Agent
- Fetches latest news

- Example: "What's the current Bitcoin price?"

### 6. Health Information Agent
- Provides health-related information
- Includes medication details
- Local database of common conditions
- Example: "What are common medications for headaches?"

### 7. Recipe Agent
- Finds recipes and cooking instructions
- Includes nutritional information

## ü§ñ Agent System

### Main Agent
- Built using OpenAI Agent SDK
- Acts as the coordinator
- Routes queries to specialized agents
- Handles general questions
- Manages conversation flow
- Implements function calling and tool management

### Specialized Agents
Each agent is designed for a specific task and is implemented using the OpenAI Agent SDK's function tools:

1. **Weather Agent**
   - Handles weather-related queries
   - Provides detailed weather information
   - Uses OpenWeatherMap API
   - Implements function tools for weather data retrieval

2. **Email Agent**
   - Manages email sending
   - Handles SMTP communication
   - Supports HTML formatting

3. **Translation Agent**
   - Handles language translation
   - Supports multiple languages
   - Uses Google Translate

4. **News Agent**
   - Fetches latest news
   - Supports category filtering
   - Uses NewsData.io API

5. **Cryptocurrency Agent**
   - Provides crypto prices
   - Supports multiple cryptocurrencies
   - Uses CoinGecko API

6. **Health Agent**
   - Provides health information
   - Includes medication details
   - Uses local database

7. **Recipe Agent**
   - Finds recipes
   - Provides cooking instructions
   - Uses Spoonacular API

8. **Motivation Agent**
   - Provides motivational quotes
   - Supports categories
   - Uses ZenQuotes API

9. **Location Agent**
   - Calculates distances
   - Provides route information

## üîÑ Workflow

1. User sends a message
2. Main Agent (using OpenAI Agent SDK) analyzes the query
3. Query is routed to appropriate specialized agent
4. Specialized agent processes the query using relevant tools
5. Response is formatted and sent back to user

## üìù Example Queries

- Weather: "What's the weather in London?"
- Email: "Send an email to john@example.com"
- Translation: "Translate 'Hello' to French"
- News: "Show me latest technology news"
- Crypto: "What's the current Bitcoin price?"
- Health: "What are common medications for headaches?"
- Recipe: "How do I make chocolate cake?"
- Motivation: "Give me some motivational quotes"
- Location: "What's the distance between New York and Boston?"

## üîí Security

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- SMTP credentials are securely handled
- No sensitive data is stored locally

### Using OpenAI Agent SDK

The project leverages the OpenAI Agent SDK for:
- Agent creation and management
- Function tool implementation
- Tool calling and execution
- Conversation flow control
- Error handling and retries

Example of agent creation:
```python
from agents import Agent, function_tool

@function_tool("weather")
def get_weather(city: str):
    # Weather tool implementation
    pass

weather_agent = Agent(
    name="Weather Agent",
    instructions="Use the weather tool for weather-related questions.",
    tools=[get_weather]
)
```
